summary: "At the young age of 20 years old, while deployed as a member of the Pennsylvania Reserves, William Iams made an ill-advised cheer. What immediately followed was his torture by his own commanders nearly to the point of unconsciousness, literal tar and feathering out of camp, dismissal from the Army, and an national news spectacle with court-room drama.  And ultimately, his violent death only four years later."
