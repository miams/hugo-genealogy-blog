## Recommendations for Further Research

- Investigate the relationship with the estate of **George Puddington**, as Burgess's conditional gift to son Edward hints at an important underlying historical context.
- Examine the named properties ("Betty’s Choice," "Morley’s Lott," "Benjamin's More," etc.) in historical land records for greater context regarding colonial land use and development.
- Research the named supervisors (Nicholas Sewall, Nicholas Gassaway, Henry Hanslapp) to explore the extended familial or social networks within the colonial elite.
