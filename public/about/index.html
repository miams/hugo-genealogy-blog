This blog seeks to discover, document and elucidate the origins of William Iiams, a colonial settler in the Province of Maryland in British America in the mid-17th century.  The first record we have of William is his marriage to Elizabeth Cheyney in 1671 at All Hallow&rsquo;s Parish located along the banks of the South River in Anne Arundel, Maryland approximately 6 miles to the west of Annapolis.  William, like most setters of area, was a tobacco farmer. There is no record of how, or when William arrived in the New World, or where he came from. Family lore from a diverse group of descendants describes the family as being of Welsh origin."
