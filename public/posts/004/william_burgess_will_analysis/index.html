  "articleBody": "Analysis and Summary of the Will of William Burgess (1622–1686) The following is a detailed analysis and summary of the 1685 Will of William Burgess of Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\nWhat is significant about William Burgess William Burgess is worthy of a full biography post, so we will write more about him later. Just within the context of William Iiams, Burgess is interesting for the following reasons.\nHe came to Anne Arundel via Virginia, not directly from England. In 1650, he lead a group of 150 settlers from Virginia to the South River area of Anne Arundel.1\nIt is said he’s originally from Truro, Cornwall, with some even believing Truro is in Wales.2 Both Wales and Cornwall are prime candidates for the origin of William Iiams.\nWilliam Burgess was one of the wealthiest, and most powerful colonists in that area. He was a Colonel, responsible for leading the militia defending the area from attacks and the Maryland Governor appointed him to key positions throughout his life.\nWe have a direct connection to William Burgess via his son, Benjamin and William Iiams’ daughter, Hester. The couple had an affair that resulted in the birth of daughter, Ann. An excellent article exists about Hester’s illicit relationships by Katherine Harbury.3\nSummary of William Burgess’s Will Beginning of William Burgess will. Imaged enhanced via ChatGPT-4 to look like laid paper used at the time.\nWilliam Burgess’s will,4 dated 11 July 1685, provides extensive instructions concerning his religious beliefs, burial wishes, debts, and the distribution of his substantial estate among family members, friends, and a servant. It shows careful planning for the financial security of his wife, Ursula, and provisions for his children’s inheritances. The document is one of only two wills from Anne Arundel colonists found in the England’s National Archives, likely because several of William’s children had moved to England. For convenience, the full document from the National Archives is posted here, as well as a transcription created using ChatGPT-4.\nBeneficiaries and Bequests Wife Ursula Burgess: Named sole executrix. Receives life estate in the plantation dwelling on South River and adjoining 800 acres purchased from George Westall. Excluded from rights or profits from the Town of London established on part of that land. Receives all residual real and personal property. Holds guardianship and control over minor children’s inheritances unless remarried; otherwise, guardianship passes to named supervisors. Sons Name Monetary/Tobacco Bequest Land Bequest \u0026 Acreage Conditions Edward Burges 5,000 lbs tobacco or 5 shillings (conditionally) None Must equally divide livestock from George Puddington’s estate or receives only 5 shillings George Burges 5,000 lbs tobacco None None William Burges £200 at age 21 Home plantation, South River (800 acres) + “Betty’s Choice,” Baltimore Co. (440 acres) Survives to age 21 John Burges £200 at age 21 4 tracts (Morley’s Lott, Bednall Greene, Benjamin’s More, Benjamin’s Addition) near Herring Creek (800 acres) Survives to age 21 Joseph Burges £200 at age 21 3 tracts (Abbott’s, Huntington, Beard’s Habitation) near South River (1,340 acres) Survives to age 21 Benjamin Burges £200 at age 21 “Bessington” near the Ridge (300 acres), “Burges Choice,” near South River (400 acres) Survives to age 21 Charles Burges £200 at age 21 Land near Sassafras River, Cecil Co. (300 acres), and South side Susquehanna River, Baltimore Co. (500 acres) Survives to age 21 Note: Survivorship conditions ensure property passes to surviving sons in age order if any die before age 21.\nDaughters \u0026 Grandchildren Name Monetary Bequest Special Conditions Elizabeth Burges £300 at age 16 or marriage Survivorship among daughters Anne Burges £300 at age 16 or marriage Survivorship among daughters Susanna Burges £300 at age 16 or marriage Survivorship among daughters Susannah (Burgess) Sewall £5 plus Burgess’s “stale ring of gold” Already married to Major Nicholas Sewall Grandson Charles Sewall £5 None Granddaughter Jane Sewall £15 to buy a piece of silver plate None Note: Daughter survivorship clause—inheritances shared among surviving daughters if any die before eligibility.\nServant Richard (Carpenter): £5 upon completing his term of servitude (unusual and noteworthy recognition). Supervisors/Overseers Major Nicholas Sewall, Major Nicholas Gassaway, Captain Henry Hanslapp: Each receives £5 as a token of friendship and to oversee guardianship in case Ursula remarries. Interesting or Unusual Details Wealth \u0026 Land Ownership: William Burgess was exceptionally wealthy, owning extensive land holdings across multiple Maryland counties, including Anne Arundel, Baltimore, and Cecil. This clearly indicates his prominence and economic influence in colonial Maryland. Town Planning: Burgess owned property designated for a new town, “London,” suggesting his role in early colonial urban development. Complex Survivorship Clauses: These clauses reveal thoughtful estate planning to retain family wealth despite the high mortality rates of the era. Indentured Servant Bequest: It was relatively unusual at this period to make specific monetary gifts to indentured servants, indicating Burgess valued and rewarded loyalty. Conditional Gift to Edward: The provision tied to Edward regarding the division of George Puddington’s livestock hints at an important underlying historical context. Tobacco as Currency: Large bequests were specified in tobacco (“5,000 pounds in Casque”), highlighting the central economic role tobacco played in colonial Maryland. Provisions Concerning Widowhood: Burgess explicitly provided measures ensuring his wife’s rights and authority would shift to trusted friends if she remarried, indicating a desire to protect estate integrity and minors’ inheritances. Historical Context and Genealogical Significance This will is invaluable for genealogical research. It precisely identifies relationships, land tracts, and interconnected families, reflecting social status, colonial economics, inheritance practices, and the legal mechanisms of the era.\nIt also offers significant research avenues to historians interested in colonial Maryland settlement patterns, early urban planning, land transactions, and the use of indentured labor.\nRecommendations for Further Research Investigate the relationship with the estate of George Puddington, as Burgess’s conditional gift to son Edward hints at an important underlying historical context. Examine the named properties (“Betty’s Choice,” “Morley’s Lott,” “Benjamin’s More,” etc.) in historical land records for greater context regarding colonial land use and development. Research the named supervisors (Nicholas Sewall, Nicholas Gassaway, Henry Hanslapp) to explore the extended familial or social networks within the colonial elite. This will represents an extraordinary record of 17th-century colonial life, illustrating economic, familial, and societal dimensions in early Maryland history.\nJoshua Dorsey Warfield, The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland: A Genealogical and Biographical Review from Wills, Deeds and Church Records (Baltimore, Maryland: Kohn \u0026 Pollock, 1905), p. 12. ↩︎\nImage of plaquerd of William Burgess. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/30662407/william-burgess ↩︎\nKatherine E.

<p>We have a direct connection to William Burgess via his son, Benjamin and William Iiams&rsquo; daughter, Hester. The couple had an affair that resulted in the birth of daughter, Ann.

<p>William Burgess&rsquo;s will,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> dated <strong>11 July 1685</strong>, provides extensive instructions concerning his religious beliefs, burial wishes, debts, and the distribution of his substantial estate among family members, friends, and a servant. It shows careful planning for the financial security of his wife, Ursula, and provisions for his children&rsquo;s inheritances. The document is one of only two wills from Anne Arundel colonists found in the England&rsquo;s National Archives, likely because several of William&rsquo;s children had moved to England. For convenience, the <a href="/documents/PROB-11-396-53.pdf">full document from the National Archives is posted here</a>, as well as a <a href="/documents/burgess-transcribed-will.txt">transcription</a> created using ChatGPT-4.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wealth &amp; Land Ownership</strong>: William Burgess was exceptionally wealthy, owning extensive land holdings across multiple Maryland counties, including Anne Arundel, Baltimore, and Cecil. This clearly indicates his prominence and economic influence in colonial Maryland.</li>
<li><strong>Town Planning</strong>: Burgess owned property designated for a new town, &ldquo;London,&rdquo; suggesting his role in early colonial urban development.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Survivorship Clauses</strong>: These clauses reveal thoughtful estate planning to retain family wealth despite the high mortality rates of the era.</li>
<li><strong>Indentured Servant Bequest</strong>: It was relatively unusual at this period to make specific monetary gifts to indentured servants, indicating Burgess valued and rewarded loyalty.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional Gift to Edward</strong>: The provision tied to Edward regarding the division of George Puddington&rsquo;s livestock hints at an important underlying historical context.</li>
<li><strong>Tobacco as Currency</strong>: Large bequests were specified in tobacco (&ldquo;5,000 pounds in Casque&rdquo;), highlighting the central economic role tobacco played in colonial Maryland.</li>
<li><strong>Provisions Concerning Widowhood</strong>: Burgess explicitly provided measures ensuring his wife&rsquo;s rights and authority would shift to trusted friends if she remarried, indicating a desire to protect estate integrity and minors&rsquo; inheritances.</li>

<p>This will is invaluable for genealogical research. It precisely identifies relationships, land tracts, and interconnected families, reflecting social status, colonial economics, inheritance practices, and the legal mechanisms of the era.</p>
<p>It also offers significant research avenues to historians interested in colonial Maryland settlement patterns, early urban planning, land transactions, and the use of indentured labor.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-for-further-research">Recommendations for Further Research<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#recommendations-for-further-research">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Investigate the relationship with the estate of <strong>George Puddington</strong>, as Burgess&rsquo;s conditional gift to son Edward hints at an important underlying historical context.</li>
<li>Examine the named properties (&ldquo;Betty’s Choice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morley’s Lott,&rdquo; &ldquo;Benjamin&rsquo;s More,&rdquo; etc.) in historical land records for greater context regarding colonial land use and development.</li>
<li>Research the named supervisors (Nicholas Sewall, Nicholas Gassaway, Henry Hanslapp) to explore the extended familial or social networks within the colonial elite.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This will represents an extraordinary record of 17th-century colonial life, illustrating economic, familial, and societal dimensions in early Maryland history.</strong></p>
